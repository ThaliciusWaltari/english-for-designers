# Hi stranger, It's me Jan.
## Who, you ask? 
Well, first of all I'm nothing more than a bunch of atoms slammed together that formed mass which is aware of its own consciousness, have will to live (probably) and will die...but enough of Nietzsches-like perspective. I'm 24 old dude, who likes to work on exciting projects, tune cars, drive cars fast, collect sythwave vinyls, go to gym, play World of Warcraft and spend time with my friends and family.
## What exciting projects?
My primary area of expertise are motion graphic design and VR/AR technology. At CNN Prima News I help design and develop new face of news graphics as well as LED screens in studio, also im responislbe for implementing AR technology. As if this wasn't enough, I also teach 3D visualisation at high school. In 2023 i was with my frined in Australia to help at Sky News Australia to implement AR technology to their studio.

### This is exaple of real-time AR in studio. 
It's 1:1 model of SpaceX Dragon capsule that was used to carry astronauts to ISS.
