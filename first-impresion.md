
# Hi stranger, It's me Jan.
## Who, you ask? 
Well, first of all I'm nothing more than a bunch of atoms slammed together that formed mass which is aware of its own consciousness, have will to live (probably) and will die...but enough of Nietzsches-like perspective. 

I'm 24 old dude, who likes to work on exciting projects with firends, tune and drive cars, collect sythwave vinyls, go to gym and play World of Warcraft.

In flesh i look something like this:
*(I have beard now)*

## What exciting projects?
My primary area of expertise are motion graphic design and VR/AR technology. At CNN Prima News I help design and develop new face of news graphics as well as LED screens in studio, also im responislbe for implementing AR technology. As if this wasn't enough, I also teach 3D visualisation at high school. In 2023 i was with my frined in Australia to help at Sky News Australia to implement AR technology to their studio.

## Enough of plain text, you are here for some pictures right?

### This is exaple of real-time AR in studio. 
It's 1:1 model of SpaceX Dragon capsule that was used to carry astronauts to ISS.

### VR visualisation for Preciosa Lightning.
Most of my 3D visualisation are made in Unreal Engine 5, so my customers can experince 1:1 representation of their concepts in VR. The imersion of VR gives them much more better feedback that they need than regular static 3D renders or animated camera flythroughts.

### And another 3D visualisation.
