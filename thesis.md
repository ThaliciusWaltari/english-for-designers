# Synchronizing real studio camera with with virtual camera in Unreal Engine for realtime production. 
I have chose this topic because on internet there is really not much guides and documentation covering this topic, mainly becouse it's complexity.
Synchronizing studio cameras and virtual ones have been my job for past 2 years and i can only do it becouse i will always find ways how. 
Sometimes i even hear that i have "talent" for conecting systems where no conection was thought to be posible. 
While that may be true I think it's more of my deep understanding on how Unreal Engine and broadcasting programs works rather than "talent". 
In the end its just buch of outputs and inputs where you have to conect binary 0 or 1 with another coresponding 0 and 1.
So i have decided to document this whole proces in a form of bachelor thesis. Maybe i will even try to somehow publish it or convert it into youtube video so other can replicate it and we can alltogether move reality and virtual space more closer (or even merge it maybe on day ? :O).
This conection is most usable in broadcasting and filmmaking indutry beacouse you can combine real studio set with virtual objects or with use of greenscreen you can bring people in to the virtual scene and all of this in realtime.
