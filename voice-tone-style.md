# Voice, Tone, and Style
## Voice
I always try to be **friendly and polite** as much as i can. I usually don't like when people are uncomfortable in conversations, so I always try to get them on same level of **openness, optimism and care-free** as myself. 

There are of course situations when i dont not care if someone is comfortable in conversation and this is mostly in situations **when i have to get my way**. I will find every argument just to **destroy my opponent, assert dominance** in conversations that are crucial and make sure they know when i have **higher intellectual or informational ground**. 

Than it's literally this kind of situation:

So i would break down my voice to:
1) Optimistic
2) Open and inviting
3) Straightforward and direct
4) Assertive
## Tone

### Friendly
As I mentioned above i always make sure that I'm frindly in conversation as much as i can. I like to help and guide people so it's crucial for me to be that way so people can be open and trust me.
### Agresive
Yeah, when I'm in a heated conversation and have a better infromation, knowledge and understanding of specific problem I'm tough opponent and I go through skulls and bones just to win that conversation.
### Profesional
Friendly or agresive, I always try to stay profeesional in conversations. Especially in a heated conversations I make sure is not personal and I'm not atacking the person but rather his believes and thoughts. (Sadly, a lot of people thinks that attacking ideas = attacking the person)
### Open-minded
This stems not only from how profesional i try to be, but from my whole live and ideology. I'm open to conversations to any topic, even those which may be deemed as edgy, scandalous or taboos. I'm always open for someone to challenge my knowladge, believes and ideology and I'm always glad when someone does that as it is the only way how to better as a person.

## Style
### Emojis
I use few emojis, mostly in conversations that i want to be more light and not too serious. Also in cases that i want to somehow show my emotion to reciever or make sure that they know what is satire and irony and what not. In my opinion this can be sometimes really crucial, since you can't see the other person and make sure that they see your emotion and face expresion.

### Complete sentences
When I'm chatting with someone I always write complete sentences with all diacritics, first capital letter and dot or comma. And i especially hate when someone is not using diacritics. It can tell you that person is lazy, inpacient and doesn't care about how other perceive them.

### Memes
Yeah memes, i use them a lot. I send memes to my boys a lot. I even comunicate via them.
