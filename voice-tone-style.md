# Voice, Tone, and Style
##Voice
I always try to be friendly and polite as much as i can. I usually don't like when people are uncomfortable in conversations with me, so I always make sure that I can get them on same level of openness, optimism and care-free as myself. There are of course situations when i dont not care if someone is comfortable in conversation and this is mostly in situations when i have to get my way. I will find every argument just to destroy my opponent, assert dominance in conversations that are crucial and make sure they know when i have higher intellectual or informational ground. Than it's literally – *It's over Anakin, I have a high ground* – kind of situation.

##Style
###Emojis
I use few emojis, mostly in conversations that i want to be more light and not too serious. Also in cases that i want to somehow show my emotion to reciever or make sure that they know what is satire and irony and what not. In my opinion this can be sometimes really crucial, since you can't see the other person and make sure that they see your emotion and face expresion.
###Complete sentences
When I'm chatting with someone I always write complete sentences with all diacritics, first capital letter and dot or comma. And i especially hate when someone is not using diacritics. It can tell you that person is lazy, inpacient and doesn't care about how other perceive them.
