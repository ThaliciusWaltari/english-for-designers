# Is there any truth to Electric Vehicles not being eco-friendly?
So there is something that has been on my mind lately and that even quite piss me of. And it is misinformations about Electric Vehicles – EVs mostly that going from a so called “petrohead” groups. 
The main part of those misinformation is that they are not eco friendly and they produce more **carbon dioxide** (thus having bigger **carbon footrpint** and contrubuting to **greenhouse effect**) than a combustion engine – mainly because energy itself is not clean in most countries and because production of battery and it’s recycling. 
You see, I’m quite petrolhead myself, I love loud, fast cars with modified combustion engines, I even have one like that myself. But I will always strife for civilization to evolve and make advancements in technology. So i decided to do my own a research.

## First of all. What's a carbon footprint and greenhouse effect. 
Carbon footprint is “The term” of today’s world, we hear it nearly every day, from television and radio, from politicians and activists, maybe even from our friends and family. But what it means? It’s a total number of all greenhouse gasses made by our activity converted to equivalent of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission.Greenhouse gasses are responsible for greenhouse effect, which occurs when light reflected from earth surface can’t travel outside of Earth's lower atmosphere because of greenhouse gases mirror-like molecule structure reflects light back to earth surface. This causes light to be trapped thus warming earth more than it would if it wasn't reflected by greenhouses gasses in lower atmosphere. Carbon footprint is highly correlated with the share of clean energy in total energy produced by each state or region.

## Carbon footrpint of manufacturing a new car.
Every material used for a product, needs to be collected, transported, and processed. And this lifecycle of a material that is transforming into a product have its own carbon footprint, which differs geographically. Collaborative study of scientists for ScienceDirect.com revealed that in **China** **“CO2 emissions from production of **BEV** is about **14,6 t**, 60% higher than ICEV with emissions of 9,2 t.”** [2], in **USA “CO2 emissions from production of an ICEV is about 6,4 t and the level of BEV is 8.4 t.”** [2] In the same study data for European Union are not reliable, because it work with outdated dataset and do not use reliable source. To calculate better numbers, I have combined data from 2019 of “Market share by car segment” [4] with data from 2018 report “production emissions of BEVs and ICEV by size of passenger car” [3] (figure 3.3). Car size “medium” in the study [3] have MS (market share) 80.6 % and corresponds with SUV, Subcompacts, Compacts, Midsize, “mini” have MS 7,5 % – City-cars, “large” have MS 8,3 % – MPV, Van and “luxury” have MS 3.3 % – Executive, Sport, Luxury.
