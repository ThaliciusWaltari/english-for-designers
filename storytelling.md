# Is there any truth to Electric Vehicles not being eco?
So there is something that has been on my mind lately and that even quite piss me of. And it is misinformations about Electric Vehicles – Evs mostly that going from a so called “petrohead” groups. 
The main part of those misinformation is that they are not eco friendly and they produce more carbon dioxide than a combustion engine – mainly because energy itself is not clean in most countries and because production of battery and it’s recycling. 
You see, I’m quite petrolhead myself, I love loud, fast cars with modified combustion engines, I even have one like that myself. But I will always strife for civilization to evolve and make advancements in technology. So today I will do a research.
