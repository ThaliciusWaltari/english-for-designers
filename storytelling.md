# Is there any truth to Electric Vehicles not being eco-friendly?
So there is something that has been on my mind lately and that even quite piss me of. And it is misinformations about Electric Vehicles – EVs mostly that going from a so called “petrohead” groups. 
The main part of those misinformation is that they are not eco friendly and they produce more **carbon dioxide** (thus having bigger **carbon footrpint** and contrubuting to **greenhouse effect**) than a combustion engine – mainly because energy itself is not clean in most countries and because production of battery and it’s recycling. 
You see, I’m quite petrolhead myself, I love loud, fast cars with modified combustion engines, I even have one like that myself. But I will always strife for civilization to evolve and make advancements in technology. So i decided to do my own a research.

## First of all. What's a carbon footprint and greenhouse effect. 
Carbon footprint is “The term” of today’s world, we hear it nearly every day, from television and radio, from politicians and activists, maybe even from our friends and family. But what it means? It’s a total number of all greenhouse gasses made by our activity converted to equivalent of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission.Greenhouse gasses are responsible for greenhouse effect, which occurs when light reflected from earth surface can’t travel outside of Earth's lower atmosphere because of greenhouse gases mirror-like molecule structure reflects light back to earth surface. This causes light to be trapped thus warming earth more than it would if it wasn't reflected by greenhouses gasses in lower atmosphere. Carbon footprint is highly correlated with the share of clean energy in total energy produced by each state or region.

## Carbon footrpint of manufacturing a new car.
Every material used for a product, needs to be collected, transported, and processed. And this lifecycle of a material that is transforming into a product have its own carbon footprint, which differs geographically. Collaborative study of scientists for ScienceDirect.com revealed that in **China** **“CO2 emissions from production of **BEV** is about **14,6 t**, 60% higher than ICEV with emissions of 9,2 t.”** [2], in **USA “CO2 emissions from production of an ICEV is about 6,4 t and the level of BEV is 8.4 t.”** [2] In the same study data for European Union are not reliable, because it work with outdated dataset and do not use reliable source. To calculate better numbers, I have combined data from 2019 of “Market share by car segment” [4] with data from 2018 report “production emissions of BEVs and ICEV by size of passenger car” [3] (figure 3.3). Car size “medium” in the study [3] have MS (market share) 80.6 % and corresponds with SUV, Subcompacts, Compacts, Midsize, “mini” have MS 7,5 % – City-cars, “large” have MS 8,3 % – MPV, Van and “luxury” have MS 3.3 % – Executive, Sport, Luxury.

The results of my calculations clearly show that, in Europe, greenhouse emissions from production of BEVs are 79,7 % higher than ICEVs. The main reason for this imbalance is production of lithium–ion battery, which makes about 1/3 to 3/5 from total emissions of producing whole BEV, due to a specific mix of metals that needs to be extracted and refined. Share of clean energy in production area also highly contributes to those statistics.

## Carbon footprint of daily driving.
Second major factor is daily driving. Every car produces greenhouse gasses for each kilometer driven, including BEVs, HEVs, PHEVs and other more ecological solutions than ICEVs. How is that possible? CO2 emissions are complex chain of dependencies – every car is dependent on energy such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, or electric power from electrical grid, which have diverse source, based on a country or region – such as coal, oil, renewable energy (solar energy, hydro, wind), natural gas and nuclear. Energy efficiency of BEVs is 90 %, meaning that only 10% of the energy generated by the electric motor has been lost in the process, ICEVs have energy efficiency only 12 % – 30 %.
### Dependency chain of BEV

Electric plant use source of energy to generate electricity, which is sent to the electrical grid, from that BEV’s battery can be charged and give energy to electric motor, which set our BEV in motion.
### Dependency chain of ICEV

Oil platform or oil well extract crude oil, which is then transported by oil tanker to oil refinery, both facilities need electric energy from electric plant. Refined oil is then transported by tank truck to gas station (to this point process is also known as “well to tank” – WTT emission factor), where we refill ICEV’s tank, so engine can convert fuel to energy by combustion and set our ICEV in motion. 

### Daily driving ICEV
To every car volume I have assigned a representative car from 2019 European market and its CO2 emissions [5]. “Medium” – Volkswagen Golf, 1.5 TSI – 108g/kg, “Mini” – Volkswagen up! 1.0 MPI – 100g/km, “large” – Ford Transit 2.0 EcoBlue – 172g CO2/km, “luxury” – BMW 750Li 4.4 L N63 V8 – 218g/km. Applying same formula as in 2.1 we can calculate ICEV’s average CO2/km.

I can verify high accuracy of my calculations by comparing it with scientific research done by European Environment Agency [6], which states that average CO2 emissions of gasoline car produced in 2018 is 123,4 g/km and diesel car 121,5 g/km. Unlike my study EU’s use high precise data collected from database of all registered vehicles in EU.
If we take into a consideration that driver in EU on average drive 11,300 km a year [7], then car produces on 1,333 tCO2 per year and 15,334 tCO2 for EU car average lifetime of 11,5 years [8]. We have got a good look into how much CO2 emissions ICEV produces from combustion – that is called direct emission. To be precise in final number, we must take into a consideration WTT emissions – indirect emissions. Study made by Auke Hoekstra for Innovation Origins shows that transporting and refining a gasoline produce additional 720 gCO2/l [10]. Fuel economy in Europe is 6.0l/100km on average [9] and if we multiply it with average kilometers driven, we get to number 1 883 liters of fuel per year. 
720 × 1883 = 1,355,760 ≐1,356 〖tCO〗^2
Additional 1,35 tons of indirect CO2 emission per year is caused by WTT process. It increases emissions from daily driving by enormous 101,7 % to 2,689 tCO2 per year and 30,924 tCO2 for a car lifetime.
