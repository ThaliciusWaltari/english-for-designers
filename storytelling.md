# Is there any truth to Electric Vehicles not being eco-friendly?
So there is something that has been on my mind lately and that even quite piss me of. And it is misinformations about Electric Vehicles – EVs mostly that going from a so called “petrohead” groups. 
The main part of those misinformation is that they are not eco friendly and they produce more **carbon dioxide** (thus having bigger **carbon footrpint** and contrubuting to **greenhouse effect**) than a combustion engine – mainly because energy itself is not clean in most countries and because production of battery and it’s recycling. 
You see, I’m quite petrolhead myself, I love loud, fast cars with modified combustion engines, I even have one like that myself. But I will always strife for civilization to evolve and make advancements in technology. So i decided to do my own a research.

## First of all. What's a carbon footprint and greenhouse effect. 
Carbon footprint is “The term” of today’s world, we hear it nearly every day, from television and radio, from politicians and activists, maybe even from our friends and family. But what it means? It’s a total number of all greenhouse gasses made by our activity converted to equivalent of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission.Greenhouse gasses are responsible for greenhouse effect, which occurs when light reflected from earth surface can’t travel outside of Earth's lower atmosphere because of greenhouse gases mirror-like molecule structure reflects light back to earth surface. This causes light to be trapped thus warming earth more than it would if it wasn't reflected by greenhouses gasses in lower atmosphere. Carbon footprint is highly correlated with the share of clean energy in total energy produced by each state or region.

## Carbon footrpint of manufacturing a new car.
Every material used for a product, needs to be collected, transported, and processed. And this lifecycle of a material that is transforming into a product have its own carbon footprint, which differs geographically. Collaborative study of scientists for ScienceDirect.com revealed that in **China** **“CO2 emissions from production of **BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)** is about **14,6 t**, 60% higher than ICEV (Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle) with emissions of 9,2 t.”** [2], in **USA “CO2 emissions from production of an ICEV is about 6,4 t and the level of BEV is 8.4 t.”** [2] In the same study data for European Union are not reliable, because it work with outdated dataset and do not use reliable source.

To calculate better numbers, I have combined data from 2019 of “Market share by car segment” [4] with data from 2018 report “production emissions of BEVs and ICEV by size of passenger car” [3] (pictures above). Car size “medium” in the study [3] have MS (market share) 80.6 % and corresponds with SUV, Subcompacts, Compacts, Midsize, “mini” have MS 7,5 % – City-cars, “large” have MS 8,3 % – MPV, Van and “luxury” have MS 3.3 % – Executive, Sport, Luxury.

The results of my calculations clearly show that, in Europe, greenhouse emissions from production of **BEVs are 79,7 % higher than ICEVs**. The main reason for this imbalance is production of lithium–ion battery, which makes about 1/3 to 3/5 from total emissions of producing whole BEV, due to a specific mix of metals that needs to be extracted and refined. Share of clean energy in production area also highly contributes to those statistics.

## Carbon footprint of daily driving.
Second major factor is daily driving. Every car produces greenhouse gasses for each kilometer driven, including BEVs, HEVs, PHEVs and other more ecological solutions than ICEVs. How is that possible? CO2 emissions are complex chain of dependencies – every car is dependent on energy such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, or electric power from electrical grid, which have diverse source, based on a country or region – such as coal, oil, renewable energy (solar energy, hydro, wind), natural gas and nuclear. Energy efficiency of BEVs is 90 %, meaning that only 10% of the energy generated by the electric motor has been lost in the process, ICEVs have energy efficiency only 12 % – 30 %.
### Dependency chain of BEV

**Electric plant** use source of energy to generate electricity, which is sent to the **electrical grid**, from that BEV’s **battery** can be charged and give energy to **electric motor**, which set our **BEV** in motion.
### Dependency chain of ICEV
![Obrázek2](https://github.com/ThaliciusWaltari/english-for-designers/assets/150806048/9cebe77a-0026-4b8d-9e7e-3e47772ff7e4)

**Oil platform or oil well** extract crude oil, which is then transported by **oil tanker** to **oil refinery**, both facilities need electric energy from **electric plant**. Refined oil is then transported by **tank truck** to **gas station** (to this point process is also known as “well to tank” – WTT emission factor), where we refill ICEV’s tank, so **engine** can convert fuel to energy by combustion and set our **ICEV** in motion. 

### Daily driving ICEV
To every car volume I have assigned a representative car from 2019 European market and its CO2 emissions [5]. “Medium” – Volkswagen Golf, 1.5 TSI – **108g CO2/kg**, “Mini” – Volkswagen up! 1.0 MPI – **100g CO2/km**, “large” – Ford Transit 2.0 EcoBlue – **172g CO2/km**, “luxury” – BMW 750Li 4.4 L N63 V8 – **218g CO2/km**. Applying same formula as above so we can calculate ICEV’s average CO2/km.

![Screenshot 2024-04-30 114155](https://github.com/ThaliciusWaltari/english-for-designers/assets/150806048/9c1aa6b6-5c84-48ac-80d9-02fc41aef52d)

I can verify high accuracy of my calculations by comparing it with scientific research done by European Environment Agency [6], which states that average CO2 emissions of gasoline car produced in 2018 is 123,4 g/km and diesel car 121,5 g/km. Unlike my study EU’s use high precise data collected from database of all registered vehicles in EU.

If we take into a consideration that driver in EU on average drive 11,300 km a year [7], then car produces on **1,333 tCO2** per year and **15,334 tCO2** for EU car average lifetime of 11,5 years [8]. We have got a good look into how much CO2 emissions ICEV produces from combustion – that is called direct emission. To be precise in final number, we must take into a consideration WTT emissions – indirect emissions. Study made by Auke Hoekstra for Innovation Origins shows that transporting and refining a gasoline produce additional **720 gCO2/l** [10]. Fuel economy in Europe is 6.0l/100km on average [9] and if we multiply it with average kilometers driven, we get to number 1 883 liters of fuel per year.

**720 × 1883 = 1,355,760 ≐1,356 tCO2**

Additional 1,35 tons of indirect CO2 emission per year is caused by WTT process. It increases emissions from daily driving by enormous **101,7 %** to **2,689 tCO2** per year and **30,924 tCO2 for a car lifetime**.

### Daily driving BEV
To be able to calculate CO2 emissions of BEVs we need to know how much CO2 emissions is produced for 1kWh in grid by each energy source and its share. This will be diverse across countries as their share of clean energy differs – **lower clean energy share, higher the CO2 emissions.** We also need to know energy consumption of a car, ICEV measure consumption in liters of fuel per 100 kilometers, however BEV measure consumption in watts per hour as they only drive on electricity.

Most reliable source for this is European Environmental Agency, which does research into this subject of matter annually. EU-27 have median of 253 grams of CO2 emissions per kWh. Germany has 344 g/kW h, however nearly same sized Poland have 744 g/kWh, due to a high percentage of non-ecological sources of electricity, like coal. Czechia have 433 g/kWh, with nuclear energy share of 40,75% [12]. All electricity produced in Iceland and most produced in Norway comes from renewable sources. That is why Iceland’s electricity have zero emissions and Norway little as 18 g/kWh. From rest of the world, USA have 385 g/kWh [15], China 721 g/kWh [16] and Russia 400 g/kWh [17].

Capacity of BEVs battery varies with size of a vehicle, ranging from 25 kWh to 110 kWh, with average of 60 kwh [13]. Average energy consumption for optimal road conditions (ideal, temperature, speed) is **202 Wh/km** [14]. If we will travel with BEV for a whole year and manage drive European average of 11 300 km, we will need **2 282,6 kWh** of energy and charge our battery 50 times.

Interesting fact to mention: Lifetime emission of car in Norway are still around 34% lower than emissions per year for a car in Germany.

## Final Sumarization
ICEV production emissions are **5,9 tCO2**, BEV production emissions are **10,6 tCO2**, **79,7 % higher**, however emissions per year of driving ICEV are **2,689 tCO2** and **30,924 tCO2** for a car lifetime, **62,5 % higher** than emissions of BEV in Poland and **98,5 % higher** in Norway, i.e. BEV between age of 1 to 5 still have higher CO2 emissions, as they are catching up with ICEV leading from production. The longer BEV stays in its life cycle, the lower impact on nature it has compared to ICEV.

## So does BEVs have lower negative impact than ICEVs in a long range?
Yes, they have. If we would replace all ICEVs with BEVs instantly, all CO2 emissions emitted from cars would be effectively 40% lower. If we take into a consideration that it would probably stop industrial transport of crude oil, 15–40 % global CO2 emissions would have been cut [18]. 
It is most important now than ever start shifting to BEVs, first especially in industrial transport, taxi services and delivery services. Many companies in those sectors already switched or are starting to switch as it is financially lucrative. Great shift in passenger cars should come after market introduces BEV for less than a $25 000 with at least 500-600km range to one charge. A lot of states is already using tax benefits if you buy BEV. Unfortunately, in Czechia support is quite low, as there is only benefit to road tax and free parking in a blue zone. In some countries BEVs already made it to top of charts – in United Kingdom, most sold car in 2020 was Tesla Model 3, same car was most sold in 2019 in Netherlands and Norway, where in mid-2020 sales of BEVs exceeded sales of ICEVs. The transformation to BEVs is unavoidable and must be quick, because climate change in this speed as it is now bears will have consequences.
